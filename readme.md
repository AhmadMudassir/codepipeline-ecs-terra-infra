# üöÄ AWS ECS EC2 Launch Type CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to provision an **end-to-end AWS ECS cluster (EC2 launch type)** with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and a **complete CI/CD pipeline** using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy for blue/green deployments.

## üì¶ Features

- üõ° VPC with public subnets
- üåê Internet Gateway and route tables
- üîí Security group for HTTP and SSH access
- ‚öôÔ∏è ECS cluster (EC2 launch type) with Auto Scaling Group and Launch Template
- üéØ Application Load Balancer (ALB) forwarding traffic to ECS tasks
- üê≥ ECS Service with Task Definition for a demo Node.js container
- üíö Blue/Green deployments via AWS CodeDeploy
- üîë IAM roles and policies for ECS, EC2, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy
- üõ† CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild:
  - üì• Pulls source from GitHub
  - üèó Builds and pushes Docker image to Amazon ECR
  - üöÄ Deploys to ECS using CodeDeploy

## ‚ö° Getting Started

```bash
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/AhmadMudassir/codepipeline-ecs-terra-infra.git
cd YOUR-REPO

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Terraform

## üìù Notes

- **Blue/Green Deployments** are fully automated with AWS CodeDeploy.
- **CodePipeline** connects to your GitHub repo, builds Docker images with CodeBuild, pushes to ECR, and triggers ECS deployments.
- All resources and permissions are defined in Terraform for consistent, repeatable infrastructure provisioning.
